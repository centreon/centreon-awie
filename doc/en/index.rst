Welcome to Centreon AWIE's documentation!
=========================================

Centreon AWIE module has been designed to help users to configure several Centreon Web platforms in a faster and easier way, thanks to its import/export mechanism.
It could be helpful for configuring a preproduction environment to ckeck if all configuration is correct before exporting it to the final environment.

Centreon AWIE is based on CLAPI commands but its added value is to allow using Centreon Web UI instead of commands lines.
