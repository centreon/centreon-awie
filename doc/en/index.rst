Welcome to Centreon AWIE's documentation!
=========================================

Centreon AWIE module has been designed to help users to configure several Centreon Web platforms in a faster and easier way, thanks to its import/export mechanism.

From a properly configured source environment, you can use AWIE module to export chosen objects towards target environment. Those objects will be created exactly the same.

Centreon AWIE is based on CLAPI commands but its added value is to allow using Centreon Web UI instead of commands lines. But, exactly as CLAPI, AWIE haven't to  be used to export changes on existing Centreon Web objects in the target platform. It will be efficient only for creation of new objects.
